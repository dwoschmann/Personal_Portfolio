# DataFrame: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure in pandas. In this CSV, each row represents a record (observation) and each column represents a variable (day, temp, condition). The entire set of data can be seen as a DataFrame.

# Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in pandas. In the DataFrame, each column can be considered a Series. For example, the "day" column is a Series containing labels for each day, and the "temp" column is a Series containing temperature values.
