Project Overview

This case study focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to uncover meaningful insights about the pandemicâ€™s impact across different locations, populations, and vaccination efforts. The project involves importing datasets, transforming data, and performing analysis using SQL and BigQuery.


Step 1: Downloading and Preparing Datasets

Downloaded datasets containing COVID-19 death and vaccination statistics.

Formatted datasets to make SQL queries easier by:

Cleaning column names.

Adjusting data types.

Removing inconsistencies and unnecessary data.


Step 2: Importing Datasets

Converted the datasets into CSV format.

Imported the CSV files into BigQuery for efficient querying and analysis.


Step 3: SQL Queries and Analysis

Created SQL queries to explore relationships and calculate insights:

Explored total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

Calculated infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination percentages.

Used CTEs and views for streamlined calculations and reusability.
